## And finally, Noise Reactor V2 is out!
This is some kind of vanity project I've been working on for a while. There is actually a [Laravel version](https://github.com/evelynfredin/noisereactor) but WordPress was easier to deploy so I stuck to it.

## For this project I used:
* WordPress
* [WordPlate](https://github.com/wordplate/wordplate)
* TailwindCSS
